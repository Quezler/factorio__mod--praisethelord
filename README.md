# The Geneva Suggestion

## Introduction

Hi!

You were probably not supposed to see this mod on the portal,
but since deprecated mode doesn't hide it fully: here you are.

As the description stated this mod isn't a playable modpack,
it contains some small mods & integrations for personal use.

If you like some of the features listed below you can probably install this mod just fine.

The optional dependencies serve as a personal reminder to keep track of the mods I enjoy,
though some mods (mainly certain combinations) do unlock certain features as shown below.

Hence the suggestion part of the name: it does not get in the way of any other mods you have.

## Features
